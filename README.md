Hi, we are Britt, Tessa, Saladin and Bas. This document will provide you information about our project.

## What are we doing?
Our aim is to create awareness about the personal data people leave around on the internet. In order to do this we are working on an open source app that discloses personal information about the user in a playful way. To be more precisely, a user will give us an identifier, e.g. a name or an email adress, and the app will then show a visualisation of public personal data that is linked to that identifier. For instance, the app has collected the following information that is linked to the identifier: the person has paid for cigarettes and has liked pictures of cats. The app will then show a visualisation of a person that smokes a cigarette while surrounded by cats. Next to it we will provide some information why this seemingly harmless data is still something to think about and we will provide tips how to prevent leaving around too much personal data. As a starting point we focus mainly on public data available from the Vemno app, but we would like to connect with as many databases as possible. Visualisations should be fun and shareable [on social media], so people can start thinking about their digital data trace in a fun and easy way.

## Who are we?
We are all Codam students and we got to work on this topic because of a hackathon challenge. We were shocked by the amount of public data available about people and how easy it is to connect the different data points to each other. We strongly believe that this is a topic people should have an opinion about and is something people should be aware of.

## Where do we need a hand?
On multiple levels of our idea we need help.
  1. Linking more public databases to the app
  2. Make the visualisations as fun and shareable as possible
  3. ..Any suggestion is appreciated!
  
## How can you lend a hand?
We believe that everyone has skills and everyone can help us, either through (out-of-the-box)ideas, knowledge about what makes content sharable or of course, knowing how to code! We appreciate any input and we would love you to contact us via [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/CookieMonsters_Creepathon/community.svg)](https://gitter.im/CookieMonsters_Creepathon/community?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge). Together we can build a community that can make this idea into a success! Before you message us, please read the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Find out more...
We were inspired by this website called [Public by Default](https://publicbydefault.fyi) that visualises in a fun way what kind of data is publicly available from the Vemno app. Also we loved the idea of [Data Selfie](https://dataselfie.it/#/), that gives you an idea what analyses Facebook can do with your data.
