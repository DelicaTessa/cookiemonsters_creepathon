Since we didn't have the time and experience to write all the code we want to 
provide you with the description of our idea.

The app needs an unique identifier(for example: a phone number or emailaddress) provided by the user during sign-up.
Then the app looks into databases(for example: Venmo's databases) to find data 
connected with the unique identifier.
That data will go through a keyword list to find keywords matching the data and with 
those keywords the app makes a profile. The profile gets connected to templates to generate an image.
For example the words "bag" or "clothes" match with keyword "shopping" and will form a profile.
The profile connects with the template of the person with the bag that you will find in this directory and
then the image will be generated.

Under the image we want to provide text with information why this seemingly harmless data 
is still something to think about and we will provide tips how to prevent leaving around too much personal data.
Ideally, we want to make the step to security awareness by connecting to other datasets and warn the user
for certain cybercrimes. For example a shopaholic would get a message that they have to watch out for
phishing with emails from webshops since it is more likely they will click on that.

The code provided in the 'srcs' directory shows how to generate a template.
For example: for a female we would have a default female template and we would add
items to the template like a shopping bag. The overlay code makes it possible to
put the image of the bag on the image of the woman.
