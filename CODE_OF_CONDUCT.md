# Code of Conduct
We believe that everyone has skills and everyone can help us. We appreciate any input and we expect that members of our community all appreciate each other's input too. Take each other seriously and try to understand each other's contribution. In order to make sure every member feels safe to share whatever they think might contribute to this project we have written down some rules that we think we should follow as a community:

* We all have different boundaries to what is acceptable. If someone indicates a boundary then this should be respected.
* Following up to the previous point, some boundaries apply for everyone: as a community, we don't tolerate any sexist, sexual, or racist comments, not even in a joking way.
* We are respectful to each other as people and to their professional contributions.

We believe that the only way we can build this project is when we operate as a community. Some members contributing more than others is in no way an excuse for violating the inclusive foundation of our community.
